## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a developer who loves turning ideas into real functional projects.  
I focus on **Java**, **React**, and **SQL**, and I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems — especially in areas like **secure authentication**, **deep learning**, and **face recognition technologies**.

I believe in continuous learning and improving every day.  
Currently exploring:
- 🔹 **Spring Boot** for backend services  
- 🔹 **React** for scalable front-end development  
- 🔹 **Machine learning models for face recognition**  
- 🔹 **System design & clean architecture**
